q1
when I away from my computer

q2
I need to control what I update to Github to keep my stuff organized that's why automatic upload does not work for me

q3
forks directly at github
clone github->pc or pc-pc
branch local only

q4
having the last copy of remote allows you to keep track of latest update on the project and helps you to merge codes easily in case of a merge conflict.

q5
definitely harder without github but also hard to remember all comands without confuse some terms like pull and push sometimes

q6
use separated branch + pull request to work colaborative out of the master branch and later merge the improvements
